# ReciPro


> Our project is an all inclusive recipe tracking web application intended to streamline its userâ€™s preparation and cooking endeavors. The site comes equipped with features such as creating your own recipes, searching for recipes that other users have created, saving your favorite recipes, and creating a grocery list from ingredients you still need. Notably, a user must create an account to create, favorite, and track their own recipes.

> Each of these features will be delivered through a user friendly front end designed specifically for functionality and ease of use. In addition, our site is geared towards anyone from your average college student with a lack of culinary experience, to a world class chef such as Gordan Ramsey. Everyone, no matter their level of expertise, has to decide on a recipe and compile a grocery list, and our web app is designed to make that process effortless.
